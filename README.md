> ðŸŽ¸ðŸŽ¨ DJ / VJ all by yourself in seconds !
- [demo](https://beact.herokuapp.com/) - It's deployed on Heroku, play it now!
- [video](https://vimeo.com/226318485) - Short video of using Beact for performance!

An audio/visual interactive art piece, and an instrument that everyone play with to become a DJ + VJ.
It's based on the idea of patatap, and using two.js, tone.js as audio and visual library.
It combines sequencer with on concept of patatap.
I have added some my own animation and will do more to replace ones from patatap.
